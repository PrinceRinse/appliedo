The MATLAB script was written for a lab-based course at Ohio State during AU23. It is used to calculate resonant frequencies (and other parameters) of an acoustic system.

The C++ file was my team's final submission to the FEH Software Design Project in AU20. It contains contributions from other team members, but the elements written by me can be found by searching `Author: Ezekiel Wessendarp`. Its inclusion should demonstrate my growth in computer programming and the care with which I approach programming tasks.
